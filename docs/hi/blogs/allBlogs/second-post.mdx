# üíé Understanding Tokenized Property: A New Era for Real Estate

**Tokenized real estate** is a modern approach to property investment. It allows a single property to be divided into smaller, manageable shares, with each share representing a fractional ownership.

## Why Tokenized Real Estate Matters

Traditionally, investing in property required a significant amount of capital, making it inaccessible for many. With this new approach:

- Investors can own a piece of high-value properties without the full cost.
- It's easier to diversify your real estate portfolio across different properties and locations.
- Buying and selling shares is simplified and more efficient.

## Core Concepts

- **Assets**: The physical property (e.g., an apartment building, a commercial space).
- **Shares**: Digital tokens representing a fractional ownership of the property.
- **Investment / Redemption**: Standardized processes to buy or sell these shares.
- **Valuation**: Transparent and regular valuations to determine the value of your shares.

## Example Use Case

Imagine a luxury villa valued at $10 million. Instead of one person buying it, the property is "tokenized" into 10,000 shares, each worth $1,000. Investors can then buy as many shares as they want, gaining proportional ownership.
