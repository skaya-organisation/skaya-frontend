To unlock Skaya's powerful AI-powered code generation features, you need to configure a **Gemini API key**. This guide will walk you through the entire process, from obtaining your key to configuring it correctly in your development environment.

In the future, we will introduce dedicated Skaya API keys, but for now, integration is seamless with Google's Gemini API.

## 1. Obtaining Your API Key

First, you need to get a Gemini API key. You can create one for free from either of these Google platforms:

- [**Google AI Studio**](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) (Recommended for quick setup)
- [**Google Cloud Console**](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) (For more advanced control and restrictions)

## 2. Configuring Your API Key

Once you have your key, you need to let Skaya know what it is. You can do this in two ways.

### Option A: Environment Variable (Recommended)

Using an **environment variable** is the most secure method. It keeps your key out of your source code, which is essential for security, especially in production or CI/CD environments.

Set the SKAYA_API_KEY environment variable in your system.

**For Linux/macOS:**

```bash
export SKAYA_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key_here"
```

Add the line to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` for persistence, then run `source ~/.bashrc` (or open a new terminal).

**For Window CMD:**

```bash
setx SKAYA_API_KEY "your_gemini_api_key_here"
```

Then restart your terminal to apply the change.

### Option B: `.npmrc File` (Project-Specific)

You can also store the key in a local `.npmrc` file (in your project root):

```bash
echo 'skaya_api_key=your_gemini_api_key_here' >> .npmrc
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Less secure: avoid committing `.npmrc` to public repositories. Use `.gitignore` to protect it.

## 3. Best Practices

- **Prefer Environment Variables**: safest for production/CI/CD.

- **Never Commit Keys**: exclude `.npmrc` or secrets with `.gitignore`

- **Restrict API Key Usage**: If using the Google Cloud Console, apply API restrictions (e.g., by HTTP referrer or IP address) to your API key to limit its exposure.

- **Rotate Keys**: Regularly rotate your API keys to minimize the impact of a potential compromise.

By properly configuring your API key, you can seamlessly integrate Skaya's AI capabilities into your development workflow.
