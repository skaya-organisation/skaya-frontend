::: info
Skaya is a versatile CLI toolkit designed to supercharge your full-stack web3 project setup, with comprehensive support for frontend, backend, and blockchain development.

This guide provides a streamlined approach to bootstrap a new **Skaya** project in under 5 minutes.
:::

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed on your system:

- **Node.js**: Version 18.0 or a later stable release. We recommend using a version manager like `nvm` (Node Version Manager) for seamless version switching.
- **npm** or **Yarn**: The Node.js package manager is bundled with Node.js.

## Installation

For a global installation of the Skaya CLI, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g skaya
```

## Initiate a new project

Generate a new Skaya project using our production-ready templates:

```bash
skaya init
```
Or directly with npx

```bash
npx skaya init
```

You can run this command in Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal for a interactive prompt.

#### For frontend projects:

```bash
npx skaya init frontend
# Enter project name: my-web3-app
? Select frontend template category:  
❯ Skaya Official       # Curated by Skaya team  
  Skaya Starter Kit    # Community-driven templates  
  Blank                # Minimal setup  
  Custom Repo         # Import from a custom Git repository  
```
Select the Template
```bash
? Select a frontend template:  
❯ REACT TS    # React + TypeScript (Production-ready)  
  VITE TS     # Vite + TypeScript (Optimized for speed)  
  NEXTJS      # Next.js (SSR/SSG support)  
```

## Running Your Project

After initialization, you can start your development servers:

### Start Frontend Only

```bash
skaya start frontend
```

### Start All Services

```bash
skaya start
```
- Starts frontend, backend and blockchain services
- Enables cross-service communication
- Monitors both servers with unified logging


The `skaya start` command shows all script from package.json to start server at dev, prod or test, both locally and for server, development server ready for you to view at localhost:5173/ or localhost:3000/.


## Creating Website 

#### Create Components:

```bash
skaya create component --project frontend --filename ConenctWalletButton --ai --description "create a navbar for multi wallet connection" -s -t
```

#### Create Pages:

```bash
skaya create page -p frontend -f Profile -a -d "create profile page" -s -t
```

This creates a new Web3/smart contract project with the following :

    - Pages accessible at localhost:3000/[fileName]

    - Storybook components available at localhost:6006 (after running skaya start)
