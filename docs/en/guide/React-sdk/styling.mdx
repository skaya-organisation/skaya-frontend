# 🎨 Styling & Theming

SkayaJS components are built with **Tailwind CSS utility classes** and the `cn` helper function.  
This ensures that you can easily **customize**, **override**, and **merge** styles without worrying about conflicts.

This way, your **Styling page** explains:  
- What `cn` is and why it’s used,  
- How `className` overrides work,  
- Examples for conditional styling,  
- Dark mode + global theming. 

## ✅ The `cn` Utility

SkayaJS internally uses a small helper:

- **clsx** - allows conditional classNames (e.g. `isActive && "bg-red-500"`).
- **tailwind-merge** - intelligently merges Tailwind classes, resolving conflicts (e.g. `"p-2 p-4"` becomes `"p-4"`).

This means your custom `className` always wins.

## 🖌️ Example: LocationButton

By default, the LocationButton ships with a base design:

```tsx
<LocationButton
  onClick={fetchLocation}
  isLoading={isLoading}
>
  Get My Location
</LocationButton>

```

✨ Renders as a button that disables itself while loading.

### 🔹 Overriding with className

Pass any extra Tailwind or CSS classes:

```tsx
<LocationButton
  onClick={fetchLocation}
  isLoading={isLoading}
  className="bg-green-500 hover:bg-green-600 text-white rounded-lg px-6 py-3 shadow-lg"
>
  Custom Styled Button
</LocationButton>

```

### 🔹 Conditional Styling Example

Since we use `cn`, you can also pass conditional styles:

```tsx
<LocationButton
  onClick={fetchLocation}
  isLoading={isLoading}
  className={cn(
    "px-6 py-2 rounded-md",
    isLoading ? "bg-gray-400" : "bg-purple-600 hover:bg-purple-700 text-white"
  )}
>
  {isLoading ? "Loading..." : "Track Me"}
</LocationButton>

```

## 🌗 Dark Mode Support

SkayaJS components also respect dark mode automatically:

```tsx
<LocationButton
  onClick={fetchLocation}
  isLoading={isLoading}
  className="dark:bg-white dark:text-black bg-black text-white"
/>

```
