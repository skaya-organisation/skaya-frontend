## SkayaJS ðŸš€

SkayaJS is an advanced **React Component Library** that transforms powerful **Browser Navigator APIs** (like `navigator.geolocation`, `navigator.bluetooth`, and more) into beautiful, themed React components and intuitive hooks.

Stop writing raw API calls! Instead of interacting directly with **`navigator.geolocation`** or **`navigator.bluetooth`**, you can simply drop in a **`<Geolocation />`** or **`<BluetoothConnector />`** component or use its corresponding hook.

## âœ¨ Features

- âš¡ **Navigator-based Components** â€“ Access APIs like **Geolocation**, Bluetooth, and Clipboard through ready-to-use, styled components.  
- ðŸ§© **Companion Hooks** â€“ Every component has a dedicated hook (e.g., **`useGeolocation`**, **`useClipboard`**) allowing you to manage state and logic without rendering the UI component.  
- ðŸ”Œ **Tree-shakable** â€“ Keep your bundle small. Import only the components and hooks your application needs.  
- âš¡ **Universal** â€“ Seamlessly integrates with modern React frameworks like **Vite**, **Next.js**, and standard **Create React App**.  

## ðŸ“š Installation

```bash
npm install skayajs
# or
yarn add skayajs
```
