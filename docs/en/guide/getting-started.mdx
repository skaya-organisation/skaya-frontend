::: details Organization
In Skaya, the organization serves as the top-level entity where all participants of your group are added. You can be a part of an organization soon.

Skaya is a **full-stack automation SDK** that helps developers scaffold, manage, and integrate frontend, backend, and blockchain projects with a single CLI.

SkayaJS is a **React component library** that complements Skaya by providing reusable UI components and hooks for browser APIs.

:::

## ðŸ“¦ Skaya (`skaya`)

**Skaya** is a Node.js-based CLI SDK focused on **project automation and developer workflows**.

<div className="flex justify-center my-6">
  <img src="/skayainfo.png" alt="Skaya Info" className="rounded-xl shadow-md w-2/3" />
</div>

### âœ¨ Features

- Scaffold new projects (frontend, backend, blockchain) with templates.
- Create, update, and manage components with AI assistance.
- Start and install project environments (frontend, backend, blockchain).
- Extend with middleware, routes, and integrations.
- Designed for Web2 + Web3 full-stack automation.

### ðŸš€ Example Usage

```bash
 npm install -g skaya
```

```bash
 skaya init frontend
```

```bash
 skaya create component
```

## ðŸŽ¨ SkayaJS (`skayajs`)

**SkayaJS** is a React-based UI library that provides **ready-to-use components and hooks** for browser APIs and frontend utilities.  
It is distributed separately to keep the main SDK (`skaya`) lightweight.

### âœ¨ Features

- Reusable UI components like `LocationButton`.
- Utility hooks such as `useGeolocation`.
- Designed to integrate seamlessly into any React app.
- Small, tree-shakable, and framework-agnostic (React 16.8+).

### ðŸš€ Example Usage

```bash
 npm install skayajs 
```

```tsx
import { LocationButton, useGeolocation } from "skayajs";

function App() {
  const { location, isLoading, fetchLocation } = useGeolocation();

  const fetchLocationAndSendTobackend = async () => {
    await fetchLocation();
    await fetch("/api/location", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      body: JSON.stringify(location),
    });
  };

  return (
    <LocationButton onClick={fetchLocationAndSendTobackend} isLoading={isLoading}>
      Get Location
    </LocationButton>
  );
}

```

## ðŸ”— How They Work Together

- **Skaya (CLI SDK)** â†’ automates project creation and frontend and web3 workflows. Creates Automated Stories/ Test files.
- **SkayaJS (React UI library)** â†’ provides optional UI components and hooks.

You can use **only Skaya** for CLI/automation, or add **SkayaJS** for UI features.
