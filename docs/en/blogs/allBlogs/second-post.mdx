# ðŸ’Ž Understanding ERC-4626: Tokenized Vaults for DeFi

ERC-4626 is a standardized interface for **tokenized vaults** on Ethereum. It allows developers to create vaults that represent shares of an underlying asset with predictable deposit and withdrawal behavior.

## Why ERC-4626 Matters

Before ERC-4626, each vault implementation had **different interfaces**, making composability difficult for DeFi applications. With this standard:

- Users can deposit and withdraw from any compliant vault in a uniform way.
- Developers can build interoperable DeFi protocols with ease.
- Portfolio tracking and analytics become simpler across vaults.

## Core Concepts

- **Assets**: The underlying token held by the vault.
- **Shares**: ERC-20 tokens representing a claim on the vaultâ€™s assets.
- **Deposit / Withdraw**: Standardized functions to move assets in and out of the vault.
- **Conversion Functions**: `convertToShares`, `convertToAssets` to calculate balances.

## Example Usage

```solidity
// Example: Deposit into an ERC-4626 vault
IERC4626 vault = IERC4626(vaultAddress);
uint256 assets = 1000 * 10**18; // amount of underlying token
vault.deposit(assets, msg.sender);
uint256 shares = vault.balanceOf(msg.sender);
```
